          <p>
            Where applicable data protection laws require a legal basis, we
            process your personal information based on: (i) the necessity to
            perform a contract with you or your organization; (ii) our legitimate

          <p>
            We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect
            your information, including encryption in transit and at rest,
            role-based access control, logging and monitoring, and secure
            development practices. However, no system is completely secure, and we
            cannot guarantee absolute security.

          <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>

            needed, we will delete or anonymize it.
          </p>

          <h2>Your Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct,
            delete, or restrict the use of your personal information, to object to
            certain processing, and to withdraw consent where processing is based
            on consent. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a
            supervisory authority.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
          <p>
